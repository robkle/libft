# libft
The beginning of my coding journey:
Understanding some C standard library functions by rewriting them.

# Usage
\#include "libft.h"
Repository contains a Makefile for compiling (make all), removing object files (make clean), deleting library file (make fclean), and recompiling (make re).

Notes:
This project is part of my studies at Hive Helsinki. 
It was tested by 3 fellow Hive students as well as an automated evaluation system.
