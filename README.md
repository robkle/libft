# libft
**The beginning of my coding journey:**<br />
Understanding some C standard library functions by rewriting them.

### Usage
#include "libft.h"<br />
Repository contains a Makefile for:<br /> 
* compiling (**make all**)<br />
* removing object files (**make clean**)<br />
* deleting library file (**make fclean**)<br />
* recompiling (**make re**).

#### Note:
This project is part of my studies at Hive Helsinki. 
It was tested by 3 fellow Hive students as well as an automated evaluation system.
